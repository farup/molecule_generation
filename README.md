# Molecule Generation with VAE and RL 


Variational Autoencoder and Reinforcement learning implementation to generate molecules. 





### Acknowledgements

VAE implementation inspired by paper "Efficient learning of non-autoregressive graph variational autoencoders for molecular graph generation" (Youngchun Kwon et al) 

RL Code mostly adopted from https://github.com/aksub99/MolDQN-pytorch/blob/master/main.py
